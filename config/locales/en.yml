# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

In a modern car, there are 150-300 important parts, the total number of components reaches three hundred. Any car moves on the ground on four wheels. The weight of a passenger car does not exceed 3,500 kg, cars are produced with closed bodies (sedans, limousines, coupes, hatchbacks, station wagons, vans, minibuses) and with bodies whose top can be removed (convertibles, roadsters, landau, chaises). Models with high speed qualities are called sports. Cars for sports competitions - racing.
